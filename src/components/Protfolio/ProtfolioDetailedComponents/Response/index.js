So, what about the failure of other apps? What are the key factors responsible for the failure of millions of apps? Well, apart from the ill-conceived app idea and development and design flaws many apps simply fail because of their pre-launch and post-launch shortcomings.

There was a perception that along with the operations, app security should equally be a part of the development process. With the demand for integrating security with the product life cycle, the DevSecOps approach has emerged. This approach has already proven to play an instrumental role in reducing the security vulnerabilities of the apps.
